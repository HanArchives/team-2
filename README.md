## About this project
This school project is about building a matching application that is build with front-end and back-end together as a team. Before this as an induvidual we had to build a feature. This was just part of the application. You van check the original feature repository for the filter feature in action [feature](https://github.com/HanArchives/bloktech). Now it's on us to work as a team and make a whole rounded application.

### Concept and Feature 🐶

This concept is about users that want to adopt a dog based on their preferences. 
* The user can check some questions and based on the answers there will be a list of dogs that match the user preferences. This is though either a form or a map.
* The user can also like a dog. The liked dog will be seen in the favorite list. 
* The user is also able to remove the like from the favorite list.
* The user can login and log out
* The user can register
* The user can update their profile
* The user can also add a dog to the database. 
* And delete a dog from the database when the user wants to adopt a dog.
