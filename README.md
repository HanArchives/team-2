## About this project

### Concept and Feature 🐶
<img src="/static/img/process/size.png" alt="PawDoption" width="100%" height="auto">
My concept is about users that want to adopt a dog based on their preferences. 
* My main focus is filtering. The user can check some questions and based on the answers there will be a list of dogs that match the user preferences. * The user can also like a dog. The liked dog will be seen in the favorite list. 
* The user is also able to remove the like from the favorite list.
* The user can also add a dog to the database. 
* And delete a dog from the database.
