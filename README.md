## About this project
This school project is about building a matching application that is build with front-end and back-end together as a team. Before this, as an induvidual we had to build a feature. This was just part of the application. Now it's on us to work as a team and make a whole rounded application.

We merged the following features:
* Han: Login, register, add, matches filter and delete features.
* Nowy: Like and Unlike features. 
* Jonna: Map and shelter filter features.
* Thije: User profile and update profile features.

This concept is about users that want to adopt a dog or add a dog as a shelter. 

* The user can check some questions and based on the answers there will be a list of dogs that match the user preferences. This is though either a form or a map.
* The user can also like a dog. The liked dog will be seen in the favorite list. 
* The user is also able to remove the like from the favorite list.
* The user can register
* The user can login and log out
* The user can update their profile
* The user can also add a dog to the database. 
* The user can delete a dog from the database when the user wants to adopt a dog.
